		maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	}
}
```

	implementation 'com.github.ciceromsjr:myfinancesplugin:v0.0.1'
}
```
	
**2. clone whole repository** (not recommended)

Adding Transactions
-----

You can add three transaction types:

- Income
- Expense
- Transfer

All dependecies such as category/subcategory and credi card are searched by description.
I means that if a dependendy is not found you will get an error.

**Add an Income**

```
IncomeTransaction income = new IncomeTransaction();
income.setDescription("Sale Bonus");
income.setAmount(50d);
income.setConfirmationDate(new Date());
income.setCreationDate(new Date());
income.setDueDate(new Date());
income.setAccount("My Account");
income.setCategory("Sales");
income.setSubcategory("Others");
income.setRecurrence(Transaction.TransactionRecurrence.NONE);

new TransactionSender.Builder(this)
                    .notification(true)
                    .transaction(income)
                    .build()
                    .send();

```
